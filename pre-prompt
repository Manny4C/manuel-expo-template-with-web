## Feature Documentation
Anytime we make a new agent and add functionality, review if we need to update the Features file, which should include all major user-facing features in the app.

## Time Handling
When working with times and dates:
- **User Interface**: Always display times in the user's local timezone. Convert UTC times from the database to local time before displaying to users.
- **Database Storage**: Always save times to the database in UTC format. This is the standard practice and ensures consistency across different timezones.
- When implementing time-related features, ensure proper conversion between UTC (storage) and local time (display).

## Firebase Database
- **Indexes**: Do not create or rely on indexes within the Firebase database. Design queries and data structures to work without requiring database indexes.
